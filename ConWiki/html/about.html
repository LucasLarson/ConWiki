ConWiki, pronounced (/'k&#594n.w&#618ki/) or (con-wi-kee), is a free offline project created by Ralph Bayer as a tool to
create and maintain articles on worlbuilding, language creation and much more. Most of ConWiki's desing and function is
based of <a href="https://wikipedia.com">wikipedia's</a> desing and function. Conwiki is also private and all hosted on
whatever PC or laptop you might be using.

ConWiki is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. All the code is open source and is avaliable on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">github.com</a>.
You do <i>not</i> need to know any of these programming languages to use ConWiki. When you create an article you will be
able to freely type out whatever text you want. However, if you do wish to add more to your article, such as: links, images etc. then
this <a href="https://github.com/RalphBayer/ConWiki">github page<a> will have a guide on how to add these using wikipedia inspired syntax.

For more information on ConWiki and how it works, then please visit this <a href="https://github.com/RalphBayer/ConWiki">github page<a>.
Thanks for using ConWiki for your worlbuilding projects.
